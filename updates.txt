To get the links to check for collision
	-> Check for collision between s0 and s1 - The 2 cylinders that are the main cause of collision
	-> Initialize a Kin body via env.GetKinBody('dvrk')
	-> get links 4 & 7 using kin.GetLinks[3] & kin.GetLinks[6]

Set the collision checker for the system 
	-> env.GetCollisionChecker().SetCollisionOptions(op.CollisionOptions.Contacts)

Use the self collision checker via
	-> env.CheckCollision(kin.GetLinks()[3], kin.GetLinks()[6])


Next steps:
	Add restrictions on how far the arm can turn. 
	Can't turn more than 180 deg clockwise or anti-clockwise
	These restrictions come as penalties that the arm can't turn to such a high degree
	Implement the checker to flag that collision happens and have to explore another form of initialization
